# **Fall 2024 Github Workshop**
## Add a new Markdown file with a short paragraph (5-7 sentences) about this workshop.

The purpose of this workshop is multifaceted. Marlon and Caroline began with teaching students how to use the terminal and basic functions of R and Python. Next, we jumped into using Git through the terminal. Here, we are learning how to access Github and utilize Git through R Project spaces and push them to our Github repositories. This work is an independent project to teach us students how to use Git and troubleshoot on our own. I am adding another sentence here.
